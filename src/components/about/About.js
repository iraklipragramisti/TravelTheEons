      <p >
        We are an international group of map-makers with a variety of educational backgrounds including Geography,
        International Relations and STEM. Beginning only as an individual hobby, we decided to unite for a grand
        project to map the whole world throughout many millennia, covering archaeological cultures of the Palaeolithic
        , early tribal unities and kingdoms and slowly transitioning into our modern era.
